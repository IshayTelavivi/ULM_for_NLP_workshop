# ULM_for_NLP_workshop
This exercise was part of the preparations for an NLP workshop delivered by [Uri Goen](https://github.com/urigoren), aimed to practice NLP for beginners. The workshop included a hands-on classification task that can be solved with multiple tools, and the idea was to present a universal language model as one of the tools, although Deep Learning was not in scope.

The work included 4 phases:

1. Build a model that predicts the next word (Language Model)
2. Prepare the input for the classification prediction phase (transfer model)
3. Transfer model
4. Classification model on document representation vectors (on transfer model's output) - This phase is not included here since we didn't achieve good preformance.

The language model achieved ~40% accuracy, witch was good for the model itself, but definitely not enough for using it for the transfer model. 


I am glad I that I had opportunity to support Uri on this task as well as being one of the mentors at the workshop itself.
